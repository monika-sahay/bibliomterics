We improve the quality of quantum circuits on superconducting quantum computing systems, as measured by the quantum volume (QV), with a combination of dynamical decoupling, compiler optimizations, shorter two-qubit gates, and excited state promoted readout. This result shows that the path to larger QV systems requires the simultaneous increase of coherence, control gate fidelities, measurement fidelities, and smarter software which takes into account hardware details, thereby demonstrating the need to continue to co-design the software and hardware stack for the foreseeable future.",,,English,,,,,,,,Institute of Physics Journals; arXiv.org; Free E- Journals,,,https://sussex.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44SUS_INST/18j2vj2/cdi_arxiv_primary_2008_08571

For this to happen, the performance of quantum computing hardware needs to improve and software needs to seamlessly integrate quantum and classical processors together to form a new architecture that we are calling quantum-centric supercomputing.

In adiabatic quantum computing, a system is slowly evolved from the ground state of a simple initial Hamiltonian to a final Hamiltonian that encodes a computational problem. The appeal of this approach lies in the combination of simplicity and generality; in principle, any problem can be encoded. In practice, applications are restricted by limited connectivity, available interactions and noise. A complementary approach is digital quantum computing, which enables the construction of arbitrary interactions and is compatible with error correction, but uses quantum circuit algorithms that are problem-specific. Here we combine the advantages of both approaches by implementing digitized adiabatic quantum computing in a superconducting system. We tomographically probe the system during the digitized evolution and explore the scaling of errors with system size. We then let the full system find the solution to random instances of the one-dimensional Ising problem as well as problem Hamiltonians that involve more complex interactions. This digital quantum simulation of the adiabatic algorithm consists of up to nine qubits and up to 1,000 quantum logic gates. The demonstration of digitized adiabatic quantum computing in the solid state opens a path to synthesizing long-range correlations and solving complex computational problems.

A natural question is whether noise on NISQ devices places fundamental limitations on VQA performance. We rigorously prove a serious limitation for noisy VQAs, in that the noise causes the training landscape to have a barren plateau (i.e., vanishing gradient). Specifically, for the local Pauli noise considered, we prove that the gradient vanishes exponentially in the number of qubits n if the depth of the ansatz grows linearly with n. These noise-induced barren plateaus (NIBPs) are conceptually different from noise-free barren plateaus, which are linked to random parameter initialization. Our result is formulated for a generic ansatz that includes as special cases the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz and the Unitary Coupled Cluster Ansatz, among others. For the former, our numerical heuristics demonstrate the NIBP phenomenon for a realistic hardware noise model.",,,English,,,,,,,,Scholars Portal Journals: Open Access; arXiv.org; Free E- Journals,,,https://sussex.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44SUS_INST/18j2vj2/cdi_doaj_primary_oai_doaj_org_article_c15b72f4af3a4a639de26b2579d36812

In order to reduce the spectral weight of all other eigenvectors by a suppression factor \(\delta\), the required computational effort scales as \(O[|\log \delta|/(p \epsilon)]\), where \(p\) is the squared overlap of the initial state with the target eigenvector. The method, which we call the rodeo algorithm, uses auxiliary qubits to control the time evolution of the Hamiltonian minus some tunable parameter \(E\). With each auxiliary qubit measurement, the amplitudes of the eigenvectors are multiplied by a stochastic factor that depends on the proximity of their energy to \(E\). In this manner, we converge to the target eigenvector with exponential accuracy in the number of measurements. In addition to preparing eigenvectors, the method can also compute the full spectrum of the Hamiltonian. We illustrate the performance with several examples. For energy eigenvalue determination with error \(\epsilon\), the computational scaling is \(O[(\log \epsilon)^2/(p \epsilon)]\). For eigenstate preparation, the computational scaling is \(O(\log \Delta/p)\), where \(\Delta\) is the magnitude of the orthogonal component of the residual vector.

The choice of a two-qubit (2Q) hardware basis gate depends on a quantum modulator's native Hamiltonian interactions and applied control drives. In this paper, we propose a collaborative design approach to select the best ratio of drive parameters that determine the best basis gate for a particular modulator. This requires considering the theoretical computing power of the gate along with the practical speed limit of that gate, given the modulator drive parameters. The practical speed limit arises from the couplers' tolerance for strong driving when one or more pumps is applied, for which some combinations can result in higher overall speed limits than others. Moreover, as this 2Q basis gate is typically applied multiple times in succession, interleaved by 1Q gates applied directly to the qubits, the speed of the 1Q gates can become a limiting factor for the quantum circuit. We propose a parallel-drive approach that drives the modulator and qubits simultaneously, allowing a richer capability of the 2Q basis gate and in some cases for this 1Q drive time to be absorbed entirely into the 2Q operation. This allows increasingly short duration 2Q gates while mitigating a significant source of overhead in some quantum systems. On average, this approach can decrease circuit duration by 17.84% and decrease infidelity for random 2Q gates by 10.5% compared to the best basic 2Q gate, \(\sqrt{\texttt{iSWAP}}\).",,,English,,,,,,,,arXiv.org; Free E- Journals,,,https://sussex.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44SUS_INST/18j2vj2/cdi_arxiv_primary_2302_01252

Unlike pure-state models, its power is not derived from the generation of a large amount of entanglement. Instead it has been proposed that other nonclassical correlations are responsible for the computational speedup, and that these can be captured by the quantum discord. In this Letter we implement DQC1 in an all-optical architecture, and experimentally observe the generated correlations. We find no entanglement, but large amounts of quantum discord-except in three cases where an efficient classical simulation is always possible. Our results show that even fully separable, highly mixed, states can contain intrinsically quantum mechanical correlations and that these could offer a valuable resource for quantum information technologies.",,,English,,,,,,,,American Physical Society Journals; arXiv.org; Free E- Journals,,,https://sussex.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44SUS_INST/18j2vj2/cdi_unpaywall_primary_10_1103_physrevlett_101_200501

The primary motivation is to unearth the cause of nonclassical advantages in computation. Completeness results from computational complexity theory lead to the identification of very disparate problems, and offer a kaleidoscopic view into the realm of quantum enhancements in computation. Emphasis is placed on the `power of one qubit' model, and the boundary between quantum and classical correlations as delineated by quantum discord. A recent result by Eastin on the role of this boundary in the efficient classical simulation of quantum computation is discussed. Perceived drawbacks in the interpretation of quantum discord as a relevant certificate of quantum enhancements are addressed.",,,English,,,,,,,,arXiv.org; Free E- Journals,,,https://sussex.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44SUS_INST/18j2vj2/cdi_arxiv_primary_1109_5549

However, computing the time evolution operator can be quite resource-consuming since the total Hamiltonian is often hard to diagonalize. In this paper, we mitigate this issue by substituting the time evolution segments with their Trotter decompositions, which reduces the propagator into a combination of single-qubit operations and fixed-time system evolutions. The resulting procedure can provide substantial speed gain with acceptable costs in the propagator error. As a demonstration, we apply the proposed strategy to improve the efficiency of the gradient ascent pulse engineering algorithm for searching optimal control fields. Furthermore, we show that the higher-order Trotter decompositions can provide efficient Ans\""atze for the variational quantum algorithm, leading to improved performance in solving the ground-state problem. The strategy presented here is also applicable for many other quantum optimization and simulation tasks.",,,English,,,,,,,,arXiv.org; Free E- Journals,,,https://sussex.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44SUS_INST/18j2vj2/cdi_arxiv_primary_2205_02520

Quantum walk has been regarded as a primitive to universal quantum computation. In this paper, we demonstrate the realization of the universal set of quantum gates on two- and three-qubit systems by using the operations required to describe the single particle discrete-time quantum walk on a position space. The idea is to utilize the effective Hilbert space of the single qubit and the position space on which it evolves in order to realize multi-qubit states and universal set of quantum gates on them. Realization of many non-trivial gates and engineering arbitrary states is simpler in the proposed quantum walk model when compared to the circuit based model of computation. We will also discuss the scalability of the model and some propositions for using lesser number of qubits in realizing larger qubit systems.",,,English,,,,,,,,Scholars Portal Journals: Open Access; arXiv.org; GFMER Free Medical Journals; Free E- Journals,,,https://sussex.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44SUS_INST/18j2vj2/cdi_doaj_primary_oai_doaj_org_article_1efd79e7648245f8a27b3824c87ceee9

In this era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing, systematic miscalibrations, drift, and crosstalk in the control of qubits can lead to a coherent form of error which has no classical analog. Coherent errors severely limit the performance of quantum algorithms in an unpredictable manner, and mitigating their impact is necessary for realizing reliable quantum computations. Moreover, the average error rates measured by randomized benchmarking and related protocols are not sensitive to the full impact of coherent errors, and therefore do not reliably predict the global performance of quantum algorithms, leaving us unprepared to validate the accuracy of future large-scale quantum computations. Randomized compiling is a protocol designed to overcome these performance limitations by converting coherent errors into stochastic noise, dramatically reducing unpredictable errors in quantum algorithms and enabling accurate predictions of algorithmic performance from error rates measured via cycle benchmarking. In this work, we demonstrate significant performance gains under randomized compiling for the four-qubit quantum Fourier transform algorithm and for random circuits of variable depth on a superconducting quantum processor. Additionally, we accurately predict algorithm performance using experimentally-measured error rates. Our results demonstrate that randomized compiling can be utilized to leverage and predict the capabilities of modern-day noisy quantum processors, paving the way forward for scalable quantum computing.",,,English,,,,,,,,arXiv.org; Free E- Journals,,,https://sussex.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44SUS_INST/18j2vj2/cdi_arxiv_primary_2010_00215
