Estimating Phosphorescent Emission Energies in Ir(III) Complexes using Large-Scale Quantum Computing Simulations,"Genin, Scott N ;  Ryabinkin, Ilya G ;  Paisley, Nathan R ;  Whelan, Sarah O ;  Helander, Michael G ;  Hudson, Zachary M",,,,,2022,DOI: 10.1002/anie.202116175,,,,,"Quantum chemistry simulations that accurately predict the properties of
materials are among the most highly anticipated applications of quantum
computing. It is widely believed that simulations running on quantum computers
will allow for higher accuracy, but there has not yet been a convincing
demonstration that quantum methods are competitive with existing classical
methods at scale. Here we apply the iterative qubit coupled cluster (iQCC)
method on classical hardware to the calculation of the $T_1 \to S_0$ transition
energies in nine phosphorescent iridium complexes, to determine if quantum
simulations have any advantage over traditional computing methods.
Phosphorescent iridium complexes are integral to the widespread
commercialization of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology, yet
accurate computational prediction of their emission energies remains a
challenge. Our simulations would require a gate-based quantum computer with a
minimum of 72 fully-connected and error-corrected logical qubits. Since such
devices do not yet exist, we demonstrate the iQCC quantum method using a
special purpose quantum simulator on classical hardware. The results are
compared to a selection of common density-functional theory (DFT) functionals
(B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP, LC-wHPBE), ab initio methods (HF and MP2), and experimental
data. The iQCC quantum method is found to match the accuracy of the fine-tuned
DFT functionals, has a better Pearson correlation coefficient, and still has
considerable potential for systematic improvement. Based on these results, we
anticipate that the iQCC quantum method will have the required accuracy to
design organometallic complexes when deployed on emerging quantum hardware.",,,English,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,,https://sussex.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44SUS_INST/18j2vj2/cdi_arxiv_primary_2111_04169

With curriculum learning, we gradually increase the complexity of the environment and we find that it has a positive effect on the expected reward of a traversal.

In this way, we establish color codes as providing a natural setting in which advantages offered by topological hardware can be combined with those arising from topological error-correcting software for full-fledged fault-tolerant quantum computing. We provide a complete description of our architecture including the underlying physical ingredients. We start by showing that in topological superconductor networks, hexagonal cells can be employed to serve as physical qubits for universal quantum computation, and present protocols for realizing topologically protected Clifford gates.

MUXing accounts for the overwhelming majority of active switching demands in current LOQC architectures. In this manuscript we introduce relative multiplexing (RMUX), a general-purpose optimisation which can dramatically reduce the active switching requirements for MUX in LOQC, and thereby reduce hardware complexity and energy consumption, as well as relaxing demands on performance for various photonic components. We discuss the application of RMUX to the generation of entangled states from probabilistic single-photon sources, and argue that an order of magnitude improvement in the rate of generation of Bell states can be achieved.

In particular, in measurement-based quantum computing, checking whether correct graph states are generated is essential for reliable quantum computing. Several verification protocols for graph states have been proposed, but none of these are particularly resource efficient: multiple copies are required to extract a single state that is guaranteed to be close to the ideal one. The best protocol currently known requires \(O(n^{15})\) copies of the state, where \(n\) is the size of the graph state. In this paper, we construct a significantly more resource-efficient verification protocol for graph states that only requires \(O(n^5\log{n})\) copies. The key idea is to employ Serfling's bound, which is a probability inequality in classical statistics. Utilizing Serfling's bound also enables us to generalize our protocol for qudit and continuous-variable graph states. Constructing a resource-efficient verification protocol for them is non-trivial. For example, the previous verification protocols for qubit graph states that use the quantum de Finetti theorem cannot be generalized to qudit and continuous-variable graph states without tremendously increasing the resource overhead. This is because the overhead caused by the quantum de Finetti theorem depends on the local dimension. On the other hand, in our protocol, the resource overhead is independent of the local dimension, and therefore generalizing to qudit or continuous-variable graph states does not increase the overhead. The flexibility of Serfling's bound also makes our protocol robust: our protocol accepts slightly noisy but still useful graph states.",,,English,,,,,,,,arXiv.org; Free E- Journals,,,https://sussex.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44SUS_INST/18j2vj2/cdi_arxiv_primary_1806_09138

This note attempts to present a conceptual step in this direction. I start with a critical analysis of what is commonly referred to as entanglement and quantum nonlocality and whether or not these concepts may be the basis of quantum superiority. Bell-type experiments are then interpreted as statistical tests of Bohr’s principle of complementarity (PCOM), which is, thus, given a foothold within the area of quantum informatics and computation. PCOM implies (by its connection to probability) that probabilistic algorithms may proceed without the knowledge of joint probability distributions (jpds). The computation of jpds is exponentially time consuming. Consequently, classical probabilistic algorithms, involving the computation of jpds for
n
random variables, can be outperformed by quantum algorithms (for large values of
n
). Quantum probability theory (QPT) modifies the classical formula for the total probability (FTP). Inference based on the quantum version of FTP leads to a constructive interference that increases the probability of some events and reduces that of others. The physical realization of this probabilistic advantage is based on the discreteness of quantum phenomena (as opposed to the continuity of classical phenomena).",,,English,,,,,,,,KB+ JISC Collections Springer Compact 2019-2021; Accès IHES - Bibliothèque N.H.

Current proposed architectures for quantum error-correction with the promising surface code require a two-dimensional layout of superconducting qubits with nearest-neighbor interactions. A major hurdle for the scalability in such an architecture using superconducting systems is the so-called wiring problem, where qubits internal to a chipset become difficult to access by the external control/readout lines. In contrast to the existing approaches which address the problem through intricate three-dimensional wiring and packaging technology, leading to a significant engineering challenge, here we address this problem by presenting a modified microarchitecture in which all the wiring can be realized through a newly introduced pseudo two-dimensional resonator network which provides the inter-qubit connections via airbridges. Our proposal is completely compatible with current standard planar circuit technology. We carried out experiments to examine the feasibility of the new airbridge component. The measured quality factor of the airbridged resonator is below the simulated surface-code threshold required for a coupling resonator, and it should not limit simulated gate fidelity.

Further spatial and frequency separation between the resonators should result in relatively limited crosstalk between them, which would not increase as the size of the chipset increases.

The two models are polynomially equivalent, but otherwise quite dissimilar: one property that distinguishes AQC from the gate model is its analog nature. Quantum annealing (QA) describes a type of heuristic search algorithm that can be implemented to run in the native instruction set of an AQC platform. D-Wave Systems Inc. manufactures quantum annealing processor chips that exploit quantum properties to realize QA computations in hardware. The chips form the centerpiece of a novel computing platform designed to solve NP-hard optimization problems. Starting with a 16-qubit prototype announced in 2007, the company has launched and sold increasingly larger models: the 128-qubit D-Wave One system was announced in 2010 and the 512-qubit D-Wave Two system arrived on the scene in 2013. A 1,000-qubit model is expected to be available in 2014. This monograph presents an introductory overview of this unusual and rapidly developing approach to computation. We start with a survey of basic principles of quantum computation and what is known about the AQC model and the QA algorithm paradigm. Next we review the D-Wave technology stack and discuss some challenges to building and using quantum computing systems at a commercial scale. The last chapter reviews some experimental efforts to understand the properties and capabilities of these unusual platforms.

An exponential scaling of computational cost renders solving the time dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) of a molecular Hamiltonian, including both electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom (DOFs), as well as their couplings, infeasible for more than a few DOFs. In the Born–Oppenheimer (BO), or adiabatic, picture, electronic and nuclear parts of the wave function are decoupled and treated separately. Within this framework, the nuclear wave function evolves along potential energy surfaces (PESs) computed as solutions to the electronic Schrödinger equation parametrized in the nuclear DOFs. This approximation, together with increasingly elaborate numerical approaches to solve the nuclear time dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE), enabled the treatment of up to a few dozens of degrees of freedom (DOFs). However, for particular applications, such as photochemistry, the BO approximation breaks down. In this regime of non-adiabatic dynamics, solving the full molecular problem including electron–nuclear couplings becomes essential, further increasing the complexity of the numerical solution. Although valuable methods such as multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) have been proposed for the solution of the coupled electron–nuclear dynamics, they remain hampered by an exponential scaling in the number of nuclear DOFs and by the difficulty of finding universal variational forms. In this Account, we present a perspective on novel quantum computational algorithms, aiming to alleviate the exponential scaling inherent to the simulation of many-body quantum dynamics. In particular, we focus on the derivation and application of quantum algorithms for adiabatic and non-adiabatic quantum dynamics, which include efficient approaches for the calculation of the BO potential energy surfaces (PESs). Thereafter, we study the time-evolution of a model system consisting of two coupled PESs in first and second quantization. In a first application, we discuss a recently introduced quantum algorithm for the evolution of a wavepacket in first quantization and exploit the potential quantum advantage of mapping its spatial grid representation to logarithmically many qubits. For the second demonstration, we move to the second quantization framework and review the scaling properties of two alternative time-evolution algorithms, namely, a variational quantum algorithm (VQA) (based on the McLachlan variational principle) and conventional Trotter-type evolution (based on a Lie–Trotter–Suzuki formula). Both methods clearly demonstrate the potential of quantum algorithms and their favorable scaling compared to the available classical approaches. However, a clear demonstration of quantum advantage in the context of molecular quantum dynamics may require the implementation of these algorithms in fault-tolerant quantum computers, while their application in near-term, noisy quantum devices is still unclear and deserves further investigation.",,,English,,,,,,,,Nesli2 American Chemical Society; American Chemical Society Journals,,,https://sussex.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44SUS_INST/18j2vj2/cdi_proquest_miscellaneous_2598536707

Since such devices do not yet exist, we demonstrate the iQCC method using a purpose‐built quantum simulator on classical hardware.

However, research has shown that young people find it difficult to fully relate to the future and its possibilities, and few studies have focused on the potential of science education to foster futures thinking and agency. We report on a project that further explored this potential by developing future-oriented science courses drawing on the field of futures studies. Phenomenographic analysis was used on interview data to see what changes upper-secondary school students saw in their futures perceptions and agentic orientations after attending a course which adapted futures thinking skills in the context of quantum computing and technological approaches to global problems. The results show students perceiving the future and technological development as more positive but also more unpredictable, seeing their possibilities for agency as clearer and more promising (especially by identifying with their peers or aspired career paths), and feeling a deeper connection to the otherwise vague idea of futures. Students also felt they had learned to question deterministic thinking and to think more creatively about their own lives as well as technological and non-technological solutions to global problems. Both quantum physics and futures thinking opened new perspectives on uncertainty and probabilistic thinking. Our results provide further validation for a future-oriented approach to science education, and highlight essential synergies between futures thinking skills, agency, and authentic socio-scientific issues in developing science education for the current age.",,,English,,,,,,,,SpringerLINK Contemporary 1997-Present; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); KB+ JISC Collections Springer Compact 2019-2021; SpringerLink Journals - AutoHoldings; Springer Journals Online,,,https://sussex.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44SUS_INST/18j2vj2/cdi_unpaywall_primary_10_1007_s11251_021_09572_3

Although reliable CFD results can be obtained with turbulence models, direct numerical simulation of complex bodies in three spatial dimensions (3D) is impracticable due to the massive amount of computational elements. For instance, a 3D direct numerical simulation of a turbulent boundary-layer over the wing of a commercial jetliner that resolves all relevant length scales using a serial CFD solver on a modern digital computer would take approximately 750 million years or roughly 20% of the earth’s age. Over the past 25 years, quantum computers have become the object of great interest worldwide as powerful quantum algorithms have been constructed for several important, computationally challenging problems that provide enormous speed-up over the best-known classical algorithms. In this paper, we adapt a recently introduced quantum algorithm for partial differential equations to Burgers’ equation and develop a quantum CFD solver that determines its solutions. We used our quantum CFD solver to verify the quantum Burgers’ equation algorithm to find the flow solution when a shockwave is and is not present. The quantum simulation results were compared to: (i) an exact analytical solution for a flow without a shockwave; and (ii) the results of a classical CFD solver for flows with and without a shockwave. Excellent agreement was found in both cases, and the error of the quantum CFD solver was comparable to that of the classical CFD solver.",,,English,,,,,,,,SpringerLINK Contemporary 1997-Present; KB+ JISC Collections Springer Compact 2019-2021; SpringerLink Journals - AutoHoldings; Springer Journals Online,,,https://sussex.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44SUS_INST/18j2vj2/cdi_proquest_journals_2615623165

In contrast to more standard gate based methods, pulse based methods aim to directly optimize the laser pulses interacting with the qubits, instead of using some parametrized gate based circuit. Using the mathematical formalism of optimal control, these laser pulses are optimized. This method has been used in quantum computing to optimize pulses for quantum gate implementations, but has only recently been proposed for full optimization in VQAs. Pulse based methods have several advantages over gate based methods such as faster state preparation, simpler implementation and more freedom in moving through the state space. Based on these ideas, we present the development of a novel adjoint based variational method. This method can be tailored towards and applied in neutral atom quantum computers. This method of pulse based variational quantum optimal control is able to approximate molecular ground states of simple molecules up to chemical accuracy and is able to compete with the gate based variational quantum eigensolver in terms of total number of quantum evaluations.

The Hong–Ou–Mandel experiment is a landmark in quantum optics, showing the bunching of indistinguishable bunch. In the present contribution, we give another perspective to this experiment based on a phase space representation of the continuous degrees of freedom of the single photons sent into the input arms of such interferometer. We show that the coincidence detection in the output ports of an Hong– Ou–Mandel interferometer is a direct measurement of the Wigner function of the produced photons in a given region of space, and we discuss how continuous degrees of freedom of single photons can be used in continuous variables quantum protocols, as quantum error correction and metrology.

In this paper, we propose a new multiplexer based on three NAND gates in QCA. De Morgan's law is used to derive new equations and to design multiplexers using only NAND logics. The proposed circuit is designed and verified not only to minimize time and space complexity but also to minimize energy loss. Finally, we design an arithmetic circuit that is capable of performing various operations using the proposed multiplexer.",,,English,,,,,,,,SpringerLINK Contemporary 1997-Present; KB+ JISC Collections Springer Compact 2019-2021; SpringerLink Journals - AutoHoldings; Springer Journals Online,,,https://sussex.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44SUS_INST/18j2vj2/cdi_proquest_journals_2480787356
