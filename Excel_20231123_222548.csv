By defining the qubit state either as the spatial localization (at FF 1) or the Landau index (at FF 2) of a single carrier propagating in the ES, we show how a generic one-qubit rotation can be realized.

These can be realized through innovative strategies to provide viable, economically competitive, and scalable technologies ranging across various sectors. Quantum computing (QC) has the potential to revolutionize various domains of science and engineering, including macro-energy systems and sustainable energy materials design. Conventional approaches for renewable and sustainable energy systems solely rely on classical computing techniques that may not scale well with the increasing size and complexity of applications. Owing to the advancements in quantum hardware and algorithms, QC and quantum artificial intelligence make promising tools to handle renewable and sustainable energy systems even at larger scales. In this review, we discuss the prospects of QC for various areas of applications in energy sustainability to help address climate change. In addition to providing a brief background on the operations of quantum computers, the constituent segments of widely adopted QC-based techniques that improve the computational efficiency of quantum chemistry calculations for sustainable energy materials along with quantum artificial intelligence methods that can address complex optimization and machine learning problems arising in renewable energy systems are also introduced in this paper. We screen the presented quantum algorithms based on their performance on current quantum devices despite their promising potential. Furthermore, sustainable energy applications that may draw advantages from QC-based strategies are identified in this work while simultaneously setting realistic expectations over the potential improvements offered over classical techniques.

Corresponding design methods require efficient means of representation and manipulation of quantum functionality. In the classical domain, decision diagrams have been successfully employed as a powerful alternative to straightforward means such as truth tables. This motivated extensive research on whether decision diagrams provide similar potential in the quantum domain-resulting in new types of decision diagrams capable of substantially reducing the complexity of representing quantum states and functionality. From an implementation perspective, many concepts and techniques from the classical domain can be re-used in order to implement decision diagrams packages for the quantum realm. However, new problems-namely how to efficiently handle complex numbers-arise. In this work, we propose a solution to overcome these problems.

A number of no-go theorems constrain the ways in which a set of fault-tolerant logic gates can be universal. These theorems are very restrictive, and conventional wisdom holds that a universal fault-tolerant logic gate set cannot be implemented natively, requiring us to use costly distillation procedures for quantum computation. Here, we present a general framework for universal fault-tolerant logic with stabiliser codes, together with a no-go theorem that reveals the very broad conditions constraining such gate sets. Our theorem applies to a wide range of stabiliser code families, including concatenated codes and conventional topological stabiliser codes such as the surface code. The broad applicability of our no-go theorem provides a new perspective on how the constraints on universal fault-tolerant gate sets can be overcome. In particular, we show how non-unitary implementations of logic gates provide a general approach to circumvent the no-go theorem, and we present a rich landscape of constructions for logic gate sets that are both universal and fault-tolerant. That is, rather than restricting what is possible, our no-go theorem provides a signpost to guide us to new, efficient architectures for fault-tolerant quantum computing.",,,English,,,,,,,,arXiv.org; Free E- Journals,,,https://sussex.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44SUS_INST/18j2vj2/cdi_arxiv_primary_2012_05260

Data used for training or prediction often contain private information about users. Discovering knowledge while protecting data or user privacy is the way machine learning is expected, especially in the cloud environment. Quantum machine learning is a kind of machine learning that realizes parallel acceleration by quantum superposition. Quantum computing power for quantum machine learning is typically provided by quantum cloud computing services. Existing quantum machine learning algorithms hardly consider privacy protection. This paper presents an encryption method for image data which can effectively protect the input data privacy in hybrid quantum–classical convolutional neural networks algorithm. The user’s original image data is first encrypted, and then sent to the quantum cloud to calculate the image convolution. By doing so, the feature map of the ciphertext image is obtained by the user. The result obtained by decrypting the feature map is the same as that obtained by using the original image as the input of convolution calculation. Experiments show that our privacy protection scheme can protect the privacy of input image data in the hybrid quantum–classical neural networks algorithm, but does not affect the accuracy of the algorithm. In addition to image encryption and feature map decryption, the proposed scheme does not bring additional computational complexity.",,,English,,,,,,,,Institute of Physics Journals,,,https://sussex.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44SUS_INST/18j2vj2/cdi_crossref_primary_10_1088_2058_9565_acb966

The next stage in this quest is the realization of quantum error-correction codes, which will mitigate the impact of faulty quantum information on a quantum computer. Architectures with ten or more quantum bits (qubits) have been realized using trapped ions and superconducting circuits. While these implementations are potentially scalable, true scalability will require systems engineering to combine quantum and classical hardware. One technology demanding imminent efforts is the realization of a suitable wiring method for the control and the measurement of a large number of qubits. In this work, we introduce an interconnect solution for solid-state qubits: the quantum socket. The quantum socket fully exploits the third dimension to connect classical electronics to qubits with higher density and better performance than two-dimensional methods based on wire bonding. The quantum socket is based on spring-mounted microwires-the three-dimensional wires-that push directly on a microfabricated chip, making electrical contact. A small wire cross section (approximately 1 mm), nearly nonmagnetic components, and functionality at low temperatures make the quantum socket ideal for operating solid-state qubits. The wires have a coaxial geometry and operate over a frequency range from dc to 8 GHz, with a contact resistance of approximately 150 m Omega, an impedance mismatch of approximately 10 Omega, and minimal cross talk. As a proof of principle, we fabricate and use a quantum socket to measure high-quality superconducting resonators at a temperature of approximately 10 mK. Quantum error-correction codes such as the surface code will largely benefit from the quantum socket, which will make it possible to address qubits located on a two-dimensional lattice. The present implementation of the socket could be readily extended to accommodate a quantum processor with a (10 x 10)-qubit lattice, which would allow for the realization of a simple quantum memory.",,,English,,,,,,,,American Physical Society Journals,,,https://sussex.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44SUS_INST/18j2vj2/cdi_swepub_primary_oai_research_chalmers_se_fd6e124d_2c7b_40af_a574_11c57233e14c

Superposition of states and quantum entanglement are the two key ingredients that make quantum computing so powerful. However, not all quantum algorithms require quantum entanglement (e.g., search through an unsorted database). Is it possible to utilize classical wave superposition to speed up database searching as much as by using quantum computers? There were several attempts to mimic quantum computers using classical waves. It was concluded that the use of classical wave superposition comes with the cost of an exponential increase in resources. In this work, we consider the feasibility of building classical wave-based devices able to provide fundamental speedup over digital counterparts without the exponential overhead. We present experimental data on database searching through a magnetic database using spin wave superposition. The results demonstrate the same speedup as expected for quantum computers. Also, we present examples of numerical modeling demonstrating classical wave interference for period finding. This approach may not compete with quantum computers with efficiency but outperform classical digital computers.

The differences found between all existing calculations and the very-low-T experiments are discussed and explored via a simple numerical model that links these cross section reductions to collinear approaches where nonadiabatic crossing is expected to dominate. The new rates are further linked to a complex chemical network that models the evolution of the CH+ abundance in the photodissociation region (PDR) and molecular cloud (MC) environments of the ISM. The abundances of CH+ are given by numerical solutions of a large set of coupled, first-order kinetics equations that employs our new chemical package krome. The analysis that we carry out reveals that the important region for CH+ destruction is that above 100 K, hence showing that, at least for this reaction, the differences with the existing laboratory low-T experiments are of essentially no importance within the astrochemical environments discussed here because, at those temperatures, other chemical processes involving the title molecule are taking over. A detailed analysis of the chemical network involving CH+ also shows that a slight decrease in the initial oxygen abundance might lead to higher CH+ abundances because the main chemical carbon ion destruction channel is reduced in efficiency. This might provide an alternative chemical route to understand the reason why general astrochemical models fail when the observed CH+ abundances are matched with the outcomes of their calculations.",,,English,,,,,,,,Nesli2 American Chemical Society; American Chemical Society Journals,,,https://sussex.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44SUS_INST/18j2vj2/cdi_proquest_miscellaneous_1750428991

A critical issue to their development and scalability is the integration of multiple single photon sources in the circuits. One major category of single photon sources is based on quantum dots that are embedded in semiconductor optical nanowires (NWQD) that allow their accurate handing and deterministic integration. Successful integrations of such nanowires have been reported in high index platforms like silicon or silicon nitride, with adequate coupling efficiency due the modal characteristics compatibility.

A fast-growing field at the intersection of physics and computer science, quantum computing promises to have revolutionary capabilities far surpassing “classical” computation. Getting a grip on the science behind the hype can be tough: at its heart lies quantum mechanics, whose enigmatic concepts can be imposing for the novice. This classroom-tested textbook uses simple language, minimal math, and plenty of examples to explain the three key principles behind quantum computers: superposition, quantum measurement, and entanglement. It then goes on to explain how this quantum world opens up a whole new paradigm of computing. The book bridges the gap between popular science articles and advanced textbooks by making key ideas accessible with just high school physics as a prerequisite. Each unit is broken down into sections labelled by difficulty level, allowing the course to be tailored to the student’s experience of math and abstract reasoning. Problem sets and simulation-based labs of various levels reinforce the concepts described in the text and give the reader hands-on experience running quantum programs. This book can thus be used at the high school level after the AP or IB exams, in an extracurricular club, or as an independent project resource to give students a taste of what quantum computing is really about. At the college level, it can be used as a supplementary text to enhance a variety of courses in science and computing, or as a self-study guide for students who want to get ahead. Additionally, readers in business, finance, or industry will find it a quick and useful primer on the science behind computing’s future.",,,English,,,,,,,,Springer Nature SpringerLink eBooks – Fully Open Access 2023,,,https://sussex.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44SUS_INST/18j2vj2/cdi_askewsholts_vlebooks_9783030616014

The full‐adder circuit is used in this technology for several procedures, like multiplication, subtraction, and division in the arithmetic logic unit. For this reason, the full‐adder is generally investigated as a central unit in the development of QCA technology. The present investigation demonstrates a new efficient QCA‐based full‐adder layout utilizing the TIEO gate and new 3‐input majority gate. In this design, the inputs get inside one side, and the outputs are derived from another circuit side. Other cells do not embrace the output and input signals, and they may simply be available, helping produce a more impressive circuit layout. Concretely speaking, in this design, the 0.02 μm2 region and the latency of the 0.5 clock cycle have been implemented using only 18 cells. Utilizing the QCADesigner tool, the suggested design in the current investigation has been functionally approved.

In this paper, we introduce a quantum protocol for distributed learning that is able to utilize the computational power of the remote quantum servers while keeping the private data safe. For concreteness, we first introduce a protocol for private single-party delegated training of variational quantum classifiers based on blind quantum computing and then extend this protocol to multiparty private distributed learning incorporated with differential privacy. We carry out extensive numerical simulations with different real-life datasets and encoding strategies to benchmark the effectiveness of our protocol. We find that our protocol is robust to experimental imperfections and is secure under the gradient attack after the incorporation of differential privacy.

However, the greatest impediment to realizing its full potential is noise that is inherent to these systems. The widely accepted solution to this challenge is the implementation of fault-tolerant quantum circuits, which is out of reach for current processors. Here we report experiments on a noisy 127-qubit processor and demonstrate the measurement of accurate expectation values for circuit volumes at a scale beyond brute-force classical computation. We argue that this represents evidence for the utility of quantum computing in a pre-fault-tolerant era. These experimental results are enabled by advances in the coherence and calibration of a superconducting processor at this scale and the ability to characterize
and controllably manipulate noise across such a large device. We establish the accuracy of the measured expectation values by comparing them with the output of exactly verifiable circuits. In the regime of strong entanglement, the quantum computer provides correct results for which leading classical approximations such as pure-state-based 1D (matrix product states, MPS) and 2D (isometric tensor network states, isoTNS) tensor network methods
break down. These experiments demonstrate a foundational tool for the realization of near-term quantum applications

Government quantum computing investments are often driven by national security or digital sovereignty concerns, with the language used depending on the geography involved. For example, a focus on “national security” and quantum computing is prominent in the USA, while European countries regularly focus on “digital sovereignty”. These phrases are often loosely defined and open to interpretation, and they share some common motivations and characteristics (but also have important differences). This paper identifies specific governmental entities typifying the national security/digital sovereignty perspectives, along with these organisations’ respective roles within national and international policy engagement in quantum computing. It analyses governmental structures, historical developments and cultural characteristics that contributed to this national security–digital sovereignty divide. Building on this analysis, we use the history of other technologies to illustrate how we might adapt tested policy approaches to modern political dynamics and to quantum computing specifically. We frame these policy approaches so that they do not overemphasise “digital sovereignty” or “national security”, but rather address interests shared across both concepts, with a view to facilitating international collaboration.",,,English,,,,,,,,Cambridge Journals Online; Cambridge University Press Journals; Cambridge Journals,,,https://sussex.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44SUS_INST/18j2vj2/cdi_crossref_primary_10_1017_err_2023_44

The Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, introduced in this context by Macridin, Spentzouris, Amundson and Harnik building on the work of Somma, provides a guide with which to evaluate the efficacy of two field-space bases, the eigenstates of the field operator, as used by Jordan, Lee and Preskill, and eigenstates of a harmonic oscillator, to describe \(0+1\)- and \(d+1\)-dimensional scalar field theory. We show how techniques associated with improved actions, which are heavily utilized in Lattice QCD calculations to systematically reduce lattice-spacing artifacts, can be used to reduce the impact of the field digitization in \(\lambda\phi^4\), but are found to be inferior to a complete digitization-improvement of the Hamiltonian using a Quantum Fourier Transform. When the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem is satisfied, digitization errors scale as \(|\log|\log |\epsilon_{\rm dig}|||\sim n_Q\) (number of qubits describing the field at a given spatial site) for the low-lying states, leaving the familiar power-law lattice-spacing and finite-volume effects that scale as \(|\log |\epsilon_{\rm latt}||\sim N_Q\) (total number of qubits in the simulation). For localized(delocalized) field-space wavefunctions, it is found that \(n_Q\sim4(7)\) qubits per spatial lattice site are sufficient to reduce theoretical digitization errors below error contributions associated with approximation of the time-evolution operator and noisy implementation on near-term quantum devices.",,,English,,,,,,,,American Physical Society Journals; arXiv.org; Free E- Journals,,,https://sussex.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44SUS_INST/18j2vj2/cdi_unpaywall_primary_10_1103_physreva_99_052335

A dual-rail encoding is adopted to convert information: a single-qubit is represented by the presence of a single quantum walker in either of the two parallel paths. We develop a roundabout gate that moves a walker from one path to the next, either clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on its internal state. It can be realized by a single-particle scattering on a directed weighted graph with the edge weights \(1\) and \(\pm i\). The roundabout gate also allows the spatial information of the quantum walker to be temporarily encoded in its internal states. The universal gates are constructed by appropriately combining several roundabout gates, some unitary gates that act on the internal states and two-particle scatterings on straight paths. Any ancilla qubit is not required in our model. The computation is done by just passing quantum walkers through properly designed paths. Namely, there is no need for any time-dependent control. A physical implementation of quantum random access memory compatible with the present model will be considered in the second paper (arXiv:2204.08709).",,,English,,,,,,,,arXiv.org; Free E- Journals,,,https://sussex.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44SUS_INST/18j2vj2/cdi_arxiv_primary_2112_08119

Another distinguishing feature of this text is our detailed discussion of the circuit complexity of quantum algorithms. To the extent possible we have presented the material in a form that is accessible to the computer scientist, but in many cases we retain the conventional physics notation so that the reader will also be able to consult the relevant quantum computing literature. Although we expect the reader to have a solid understanding of linear algebra, we do not assume a background in physics. This text is based on lectures given as short courses and invited presentations around the world, and it has been used as the primary text for a graduate course at George Mason University. In all these cases our challenge has been the same: how to present to a general audience a concise introduction to the algorithmic structure and applications of quantum computing on an extremely short period of time. The feedback from these courses and presentations has greatly aided in making our exposition of challenging concepts more accessible to a general audience.","Part of: Synthesis digital library of engineering and computer science.; Title from PDF t.p.

This is near optimal with respect to both \(\kappa\) and \(\epsilon\). Our method is applicable to general non-Hermitian matrices, and the cost as well as the number of qubits can be reduced when restricted to Hermitian matrices, and further to Hermitian positive definite matrices. The success of the time-optimal AQC implies that the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) with an optimal control protocol can also achieve the same complexity in terms of the runtime.

These are inspired by, but not equivalent to, the notions of causal flow and g-flow for qubit MBQC. We also show that an MBQC with CV-flow approximates a unitary arbitrarily well in the infinite-squeezing limit, addressing issues of convergence which are unavoidable in the infinite-dimensional setting. In developing our proofs, we provide a method for converting a CV-MBQC computation into a circuit form, analogous to the circuit extraction method of Miyazaki et al, and an efficient algorithm for finding CV-flow when it exists based on the qubit version by Mhalla and Perdrix.

Superposition of states and quantum entanglement are the two key ingredients that make quantum computing so powerful. However, not all quantum algorithms require quantum entanglement (e.g., search through an unsorted database). Is it possible to utilize classical wave superposition to speed up database searching as much as by using quantum computers? There were several attempts to mimic quantum computers using classical waves. It was concluded that the use of classical wave superposition comes with the cost of an exponential increase in resources. In this work, we consider the feasibility of building classical wave-based devices able to provide fundamental speedup over digital counterparts without the exponential overhead. We present experimental data on database searching through a magnetic database using spin wave superposition. The results demonstrate the same speedup as expected for quantum computers. Also, we present examples of numerical modeling demonstrating classical wave interference for period finding. This approach may not compete with quantum computers with efficiency but outperform classical digital computers.
