Traditional machine-learning models struggle with large-scale datasets and complex relationships. This research introduces a novel methodological framework for supply chain backorder prediction, addressing the challenge of collecting large real-world datasets with 90% accuracy. Our proposed model demonstrates remarkable accuracy in predicting backorders on short and imbalanced datasets. We capture intricate patterns and dependencies by leveraging quantum-inspired techniques within the quantum-classical neural network QAmplifyNet. Experimental evaluations on a benchmark dataset establish QAmplifyNet’s superiority over eight classical models, three classically stacked quantum ensembles, five quantum neural networks, and a deep reinforcement learning model. Its ability to handle short, imbalanced datasets makes it ideal for supply chain management. We evaluate seven preprocessing techniques, selecting the best one based on logistic regression’s performance on each preprocessed dataset. The model’s interpretability is enhanced using Explainable artificial intelligence techniques. Practical implications include improved inventory control, reduced backorders, and enhanced operational efficiency. QAmplifyNet also achieved the highest F1-score of 94% for predicting “Not Backorder” and 75% for predicting “backorder,” outperforming all other models. It also exhibited the highest AUC-ROC score of 79.85%, further validating its superior predictive capabilities. QAmplifyNet seamlessly integrates into real-world supply chain management systems, empowering proactive decision-making and efficient resource allocation. Future work involves exploring additional quantum-inspired techniques, expanding the dataset, and investigating other supply chain applications. This research unlocks the potential of quantum computing in supply chain optimization and paves the way for further exploration of quantum-inspired machine learning models in supply chain management. Our framework and QAmplifyNet model offer a breakthrough approach to supply chain backorder prediction, offering superior performance and opening new avenues for leveraging quantum-inspired techniques in supply chain management.",,,English,,,,,,,,GFMER Free Medical Journals,,,https://sussex.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44SUS_INST/18j2vj2/cdi_doaj_primary_oai_doaj_org_article_a444e831eca147e5ae98f72255f30abc

The results show that whilst there is no advantage seen by using the quantum algorithms, the performance of the quantum algorithms has no statistically significant degradation.

Quantum computing (QC) has gained popularity due to its unique capabilities that are quite different from that of classical computers in terms of speed and methods of operations. This paper proposes hybrid models and methods that effectively leverage the complementary strengths of deterministic algorithms and QC techniques to overcome combinatorial complexity for solving large-scale mixed-integer programming problems. Four applications, namely the molecular conformation problem, job-shop scheduling problem, manufacturing cell formation problem, and the vehicle routing problem, are specifically addressed. Large-scale instances of these application problems across multiple scales ranging from molecular design to logistics optimization are computationally challenging for deterministic optimization algorithms on classical computers. To address the computational challenges, hybrid QC-based algorithms are proposed and extensive computational experimental results are presented to demonstrate their applicability and efficiency. The proposed QC-based solution strategies enjoy high computational efficiency in terms of solution quality and computation time, by utilizing the unique features of both classical and quantum computers.",,,English,,,,,,,,ScienceDirect; Elsevier ScienceDirect Journals Complete; KB+ JISC Collections Elsevier ScienceDirect Freedom Collection 2017-2021; arXiv.org; Free E- Journals,,,https://sussex.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44SUS_INST/18j2vj2/cdi_osti_scitechconnect_1606975

With the aim of making reinforcement learning a viable technique for supply chain optimization, we develop new extensions to encoder-decoder models for vehicle routing that allow for complex supply chains using classical computing today and quantum computing in the future. We make two major generalizations. First, our model allows for routing problems with multiple trucks. Second, we move away from the simple requirement of having a truck deliver items from nodes to one special depot node, and instead allow for a complex tensor demand structure.

In this paper we validate a TaaS (testing-as-a-service) framework using an organizational workgroup model that consists of (1) a commercial Test House, (2) standard temperature Component Manufacturer, (3) Academic Partner, and (4) System Integrator to demonstrate a scalable model for the qualification of cryogenic microwave components.

The component test vehicle presented in this paper is a low-noise amplifier (LNA) which is a crucial component in the cryogenic chain to ensure adequate signal-to-noise of the qubit readout. We devise standard test metrics and protocols by which LNA performance is measured, including key parameters such as gain and flatness, reflection and isolation, operating bandwidth, and noise figure. We present details of the cryogenic testbed customized for LNA qualification, outline test methodologies, and present a suite of standard processes that are used to systematize data collation and reporting. The testbed is validated by reproducing parameters of a pre-characterized LNA. Its value is demonstrated by characterizing a proof-of-concept cryogenic LNA prototype.

Blockchain, a decentralized infrastructure, can provide irreversibility, undeniableness, uniqueness and anonymity for trades. Hence, we first propose a blockchain-based construction supply chain framework to reduce limitations in traditional ones. However, payment security by blockchain must be guaranteed and token assets in accounts must be protected. Although the loss of private keys will not result in the exposure or the modification of records in blockchain due to merkle root and blockheader hash, fake payments can be generated and all tokens in the accounts controlled by the private keys may be stolen by attackers. Existing approaches towards private-key protections include biometric-basic signature schemes, index-hidden private key designs and post-quantum blockchain schemes. Nevertheless, none of them can recover lost private keys. Therefore, we design a private-key distribution protocol in blockchains to preserve security of private keys with key recovery. Specifically, our scheme not only uses secret sharing to improve possibilities of recovering lost keys but also introduces network protocols to guarantee security of secret share transmission.

Quantum computer product roadmap
Considering the quantum computer as a product requires standardization and integration of all its building blocks and a mature supply chain that can provide high-quality components and can ensure security of supply. The product development approach puts focus on functionality and performance requirements of the product and uses state-of-the-art technology to build the product. Based on the expected requirements of future products it is possible to outline a product development roadmap.
It is expected that a fully functional quantum computer will be available within a decade from now, and will be used by the High Performance Computing (HPC) market, where it will replace (part of) the supercomputers that are currently used for complex calculations and data management. In the short term, a partly functional quantum computer will be available and of interest to the R&D market, which has a need for such a product to expedite their quantum technology developments.

In this paper, we present the product development approach and roadmap for quantum computers, based on superconducting circuits as an example. A group of companies in the Dutch quantum ecosystem (

Rather than taking this approach, we investigate a problem of substantial commercial value, multi-truck vehicle routing for supply chain logistics, at the scale used by a corporation in their operations. Such a problem is too complex to be fully embedded on any near-term quantum hardware or simulator; we avoid confronting this challenge by taking a hybrid workflow approach: we iteratively assign routes for trucks by generating a new binary optimization problem instance one truck at a time. Each instance has [Formula: see text] quadratic binary variables, putting it in a range that is feasible for NISQ quantum computing, especially quantum annealing hardware. We test our methods using simulated annealing and the D-Wave Hybrid solver as a place-holder in wait of quantum hardware developments. After feeding the vehicle routes suggested by these runs into a highly realistic classical supply chain simulation, we find excellent performance for the full supply chain.

Standardisation is indeed of paramount importance to facilitate the growth of new technologies, and the development of efficient and effective supply chains. The harmonisation of technologies, methodologies, and interfaces enables interoperable products, innovation, and competition, all leading to structuring and hence growth of markets. As quantum technologies mature, the time has come to start thinking about further standardisation needs.

We use reinforcement learning with neural networks with embedded quantum circuits. In such neural networks, projecting high-dimensional feature vectors down to smaller vectors is necessary to accommodate restrictions on the number of qubits of NISQ hardware. However, we use a multi-head attention mechanism where, even in classical machine learning, such projections are natural and desirable. We consider data from the truck routing logistics of a company in the automotive sector, and apply our methodology by decomposing into small teams of trucks, and we find results comparable to human truck assignment.",,,English,,,,,,,,arXiv.org; Free E- Journals,,,https://sussex.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44SUS_INST/18j2vj2/cdi_arxiv_primary_2212_00576

The challenge is only increasing and growing for the future, thus tackling transport optimization provides both business and social value. Optimization problems are ubiquitous and they present a challenge due to its complexity, where they're typically NP-hard problems. Quantum Computing is a developing field, and the Quantum Annealing approach has proven to be quite effective in its applicability and usefulness to tackle optimization problems. In this work we treat the Vehicle Routing Problem, which is also a variation of a famous optimization problem known as the Traveling Salesman Problem. We aim to tackle the vehicle optimization problem from the last mile logistic scenario application, with a perspective from the classical and quantum approaches, and providing a solution which combines both, also known as hybrid solution.

Rather than taking this approach, we investigate a problem of substantial commercial value, multi-truck vehicle routing for supply chain logistics, at the scale used by a corporation in their operations. Such a problem is too complex to be fully embedded on any near-term quantum hardware or simulator; we avoid confronting this challenge by taking a hybrid workflow approach: we iteratively assign routes for trucks by generating a new binary optimization problem instance one truck at a time. Each instance has \(\sim 2500\) quadratic binary variables, putting it in a range that is feasible for NISQ quantum computing, especially quantum annealing hardware. We test our methods using simulated annealing and the D-Wave Hybrid solver as a place-holder in wait of quantum hardware developments. After feeding the vehicle routes suggested by these runs into a highly realistic classical supply chain simulation, we find excellent performance for the full supply chain.

In order to reduce the production of defective items, modern/improvement technology has been incorporated in the production system. Also, the demand of the product is assumed to be dependent on its warranty period and selling price. The main objective of this study is to optimize the production rate, production period, selling price of the product, manufacturer’s improvement technology level and maximum shortage level as well as maximize the average profit of the production system.

The second method is a new iterative method (NIM) that simplifies the problem and obtains a recursive formula for the solution. Both methods are applied to the Schrödinger–KdV system with fractional derivatives, which arises in many physical applications. Numerical experiments are performed to compare the accuracy and efficiency of the two methods. The results show that both methods can produce highly accurate solutions for the fractional Schrödinger–KdV system.

Quantum Machine Learning for Material Synthesis and Hardware Security,"Beaudoin, Collin ;  Kundu, Satwik ;  Topaloglu, Rasit Onur ;  Ghosh, Swaroop","arXiv.org, 2022",,,"Ithaca: Cornell University Library, arXiv.org",,EISSN: 2331-8422; DOI: 10.48550/arxiv.2208.08273,,Computer security ;  Hardware ;  Machine learning ;  Malware ;  Model accuracy ;  Neural networks ;  Quantum computing ;  Supply chains,,,"Using quantum computing, this paper addresses two scientifically pressing and day-to-day relevant problems, namely, chemical retrosynthesis which is an important step in drug/material discovery and security of the semiconductor supply chain. We show that Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM) is a viable tool for retrosynthesis. We achieve 65% training accuracy with QLSTM, whereas classical LSTM can achieve 100%. However, in testing, we achieve 80% accuracy with the QLSTM while classical LSTM peaks at only 70% accuracy! We also demonstrate an application of Quantum Neural Network (QNN) in the hardware security domain, specifically in Hardware Trojan (HT) detection using a set of power and area Trojan features. The QNN model achieves detection accuracy as high as 97.27%.",,,English,,,,,,,,arXiv.org; Free E- Journals,,,https://sussex.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44SUS_INST/18j2vj2/cdi_arxiv_primary_2208_08273

V2V stands for vehicle-to-vehicle, as in how cars relay data to each other; V2D means vehicle-to-device, or how a car communicates with an electronic device connected to it, such as a smartphone; V2I means vehicle- to-infrastructure, or how cars communicate to inanimate objects such as stoplights; V2G means vehicle-to-grid, or how electrified cars communicate with the power grid, for example, to balance demand by throttling their charging rates; and V2X means vehicle-to-everything, a general term that encompasses all of these concepts.",,,English,,,,,,,,Nexis Advance UK; Business Source Premier (EBSCOhost); ProQuest One Business,,,https://sussex.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44SUS_INST/18j2vj2/cdi_proquest_reports_2188700315
Green Transition: The Frontier of the Digicircular Economy Evidenced from a Systematic Literature Review,"De Felice, Fabio ;  Petrillo, Antonella","Sustainability (Basel, Switzerland), 2021, Vol.13 (19), p.11068",,,Basel: MDPI AG,,ISSN: 2071-1050; EISSN: 2071-1050; DOI: 10.3390/su131911068,,AHP ;  Artificial intelligence ;  business models ;  circular economy ;  Circularity ;  digital age ;  Economics ;  Literature reviews ;  PRISMA ;  Quantum computing ;  Sustainability ;  Sustainable manufacturing ;  Systematic review ;  technologies,,,"Today, the issue of economic circularity is certainly not a new concept. It represents an essential issue in any production system since it is an alternative to the current production and consumption model. The importance of the topic is confirmed worldwide. However, there is still a “circularity gap” that can be bridged in the short and medium term, probably with the use of innovative and digital technologies. In fact, many researchers agree that the sustainable future can be achieved in the long term thanks to digital technologies (i.e., IoT, artificial intelligence, quantum computing etc.) which, thanks to their speed of calculation, are able to identify the right solutions at the right time. The challenge, therefore, will be to develop innovative technologies and tools for the efficient use of resources in industries for sustainable production. Thus, the aim of this study is to define the current state of the art and future research developments in this very promising field. To achieve this goal, the integration of a “set” of tools, based on the AHP method and the PRISMA protocol, is proposed. The results aim to be a guideline for decision makers and researchers interested in this topic.",,,English,,,,,,,,DOAJ Directory of Open Access Journals; GFMER Free Medical Journals,,,https://sussex.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44SUS_INST/18j2vj2/cdi_doaj_primary_oai_doaj_org_article_25f2e3e30fbe4f78b56df732ec6bbad3

The nature of a decentralized, distributed ledger will truly change the way we currently trade and interact through its clear transparency and high integrity (Casey & Vigna, 2018; Sullivan, 2015). Based on trust, Blockchain allows various parties to be involved in transacting with each other without the need to know each other (Botsman, 2017; Deloitte, 2016; Drescher, 2017; Mauri, 2017). The purpose of this paper is to provide a framework for Blockchain by focusing on how Blockchain technology can be integrated and implemented into real world applications (Harvey, Moorman & Toledo, 2018; Iansiti & Lakhani, 2017). As this secure, robust and flexible technology can be applied to numerous industries with a plethora of applications and use cases, Blockchain for business can tremendously save costs, save time and mitigate risk (Gupta, 2017; Mauri, 2017). In particular, we will explore how the premise of provenance in traceability and tractability will affect our supply chains of today and tomorrow (Carson, Romanelli, Walsh, & Zhumaev, 2018; Casey & Wong, 2017; Yiannas, 2018). We will also discuss the technological limitations, the regulations and the social challenges that revolve around Blockchain and its adoption (Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés, 2018; Croman, Decker, Eyal, Gencer, Juels, Kosba, Miller, Saxena, Shi, Sirer, Song, & Wattenhofer, 2016; Iansiti & Lakhani, 2017; Global Legal Research Center, 2018). In addition, we aimed to examine the interaction of between Blockchain and various relevant and pertinent emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, 5G, IoT and among others (Carmichael & Lakhani, 2017; Loukides & Lorica, 2018). Further, we identify the conceivable implications - such as the effect on the workforce, among other concerns - both positive and negative, and how these would affect us in both the short term and the long term (Schwartz, Wooll, & Monahan, 2019). Lastly, we investigate how and where Blockchain would evolve in the near and far future.",,,English,,,,,,,,ABI/INFORM Global; ProQuest One Business,,,https://sussex.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44SUS_INST/18j2vj2/cdi_proquest_reports_2401328940
